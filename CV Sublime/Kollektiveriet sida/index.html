    <h2>Kollektiveriet</h2>
    <p>During my studies at university have a been part of a student association called Kollektiveriet. We arranged events for students almost every Thursday at the local student-bar Kollektivet, other bigger parties where approximately 800 people attended and bigger dinner sittings. My position in the association as Head of events was to plan and carry through the dinner we had for almost 200 people. My specific tasks were to make sure all the payments had been transferred, look over the reserve list in case of someone couldn’t show up, but also coordinate the placement of the guests concerning preferences such as allergies and friends.</p>
