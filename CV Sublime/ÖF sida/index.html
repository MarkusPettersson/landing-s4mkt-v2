    <h2>Överfadder</h2>
    <p>During my second year at Linköpings University did I get the chance to be part of the welcoming team for the new students at the university or as it is called in Swedish a “Överfadder”. My job was to welcome all the new students to the university, so they could feel safe amongst new people, learn about the new surroundings in an entirely new city and especially have a great time during the start of their studies. During the start at the university are we having two introduction weeks and my role was to be extra updated on the schedule for each day, coordinate the group which was over 30 people, so we were at the right place at the right time and to be social and talk to the new students, so they feel accepted and welcomed. So, the competences that are needed in order to manage the position is to be social, responsible and coordinated. And that’s why I got voted to have the position.</p>
