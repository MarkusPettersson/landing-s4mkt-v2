    <h2>H&M</h2>
    <p>During the summer 2018 did I work as a sales-advisor at H&M in Visby on the island Gotland east of Sweden. The store in Visby is the most active during the summer because Gotland is a summer-island, so you could easily notice how the number of visitors increased during the summer, and meanwhile did H&M have several of discount levels during the summer which increased the demand further. The job as sales-advisor was stressful but at the same time enriching. You had to learn H&M’s assortment as good as possible in a short time to help the customers but also to know where to place the clothes that comes out of the inventory. It was really helpful if you could handle to do many things at the same time such as to be ready to be in the pay-desk if there’s many customers in the store meanwhile you’re hanging up clothes but especially to be available for the customers who needs help.</p>
